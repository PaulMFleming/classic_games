# Four Mini Projects

_This is from a course on Zenva Academy_

- Prerequisites: Basic skills in Godot and GDScript

## Aims of this course:

- Alter object properties via script
- Build UIs
- Work with physics
- Construct loops for repeated code
- Add collision detection
- Practically apply tools to projects

## Projects

### Balloon Popper

#### Learnings

- We need a camera in 3D scenes in order for Godot to know which direction to render our screen.
- Set a material on an object by adding a new Resource of type StandardMaterial3D
- Add event listeners to Nodes to listen for events like mouse clicks
- @export before a variable in a scene allows individual instances of the scenes variables to be manipulated independently
