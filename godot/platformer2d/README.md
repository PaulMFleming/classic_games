# 2D Platformer

_This is from a course on Zenva Academy_

## Aims Of This Course

We will create multiple different gameplay features for the game, here is a list of what we will cover:

- **Player** – We will cover creating a player character which can move left and right using the arrow keys, and jump when the user presses the spacebar.
- **Enemies** – We will create enemies that will reset the player when they touch them. They will move back and forth between 2 points that can be set in the Editor.
- **Spikes** – Similarly to the enemies, we will create spikes, that when touched, reset the player.
- **Coins** – Coins will bob up and down using a sine wave to set their position. They can be collected by the player and will add to a score that appears on the screen as a UI element.
