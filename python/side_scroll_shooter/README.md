# Side Scroll Shooter

### A simple space shooter game built using pygame. 

I implemented the following features while building this game:
  - Player can move around anywhere on the screen.
  - Player faces a wave of enemies and obstacles.
  - The game ends when aPlayer loses all their lives.
  - The highest score is saved and displayed to the Player.
  - Player can destroy enemies but not obstacles.
  - Game has animations when Player and enemies die.
  - Game has a menu and a Game Over screen, both display the highest score.
