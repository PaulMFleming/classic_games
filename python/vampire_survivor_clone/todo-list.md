# Dungeon Survivor - Todo List

# NOTE: I am going to leave this game as it is, because it satisfies the core implementation of a vampire survivor clone. It has developed into another idea. I'm going to continue with the new idea in a different project to this one.

## Completed Features

- [x] Basic game setup and main loop
- [x] Player movement and controls
- [x] Zombie enemy implementation
  - [x] Basic movement AI (following player)
  - [x] Health system
  - [x] Death animation
  - [x] Attack mechanism
- [x] Combat system
  - [x] Damage calculation
  - [x] XP rewards (15 XP per zombie)
- [x] Score tracking
- [x] Visual feedback (XP text popup)
- [x] Map boundaries
